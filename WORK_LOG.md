Snakes could lead to ladders that could be a massive shortcut to the top. Wait but the player would already get to a big short cut ladder before they got to a snake to lead them to the ladder so we actually should avoid snakes. |
| September 3 |          9:30-10:00pm          | This might be hard to explain through writing, but after looking at some images of boards, I think that a fastest path could include a snake if a player takes a ladder somewhere but skips a much larger ladder. Then the player could use a snake to go just before that large ladder and then take the ladder to near the top and win. I have no idea really where to start with code since now snakes are fair play now. To start, I would probably deal with the case if it is impossible to win if there are like 6 snakes in the 6 ending squares. But what confuses me is how to calculate between multiple choices to see for example if one ladder is better than another. And I don't think that the longer ladder is always better since maybe the shorter one leads to a massive ladder that leads the player right up to the top. |

I also just thought about the problem set more with the new info we had. I wasn't sure how to count the rolls though. I started to implement some of the pseudocode very basically. |

I noticed I needed to check if a node was visited or not so I made an array to check that and I needed another array to see where the snake and ladder beginnings were. I was still confused on the counting nodes part but everything else was going fine. |

Initially I was thinking of using an ArrayList and adding nodes and removing and returning the length but it seemed a bit complex and I was pretty sure we didn't need ArrayLists from class. So, I went with the array option and debugged from there. I realized it was easier to make my previous arrays one more index bigger to make dealing with them easier. |
