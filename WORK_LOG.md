Snakes could lead to ladders that could be a massive shortcut to the top. Wait but the player would already get to a big short cut ladder before they got to a snake to lead them to the ladder so we actually should avoid snakes. |
| September 3 |          9:30-10:00pm          | This might be hard to explain through writing, but after looking at some images of boards, I think that a fastest path could include a snake if a player takes a ladder somewhere but skips a much larger ladder. Then the player could use a snake to go just before that large ladder and then take the ladder to near the top and win. I have no idea really where to start with code since now snakes are fair play now. To start, I would probably deal with the case if it is impossible to win if there are like 6 snakes in the 6 ending squares. But what confuses me is how to calculate between multiple choices to see for example if one ladder is better than another. And I don't think that the longer ladder is always better since maybe the shorter one leads to a massive ladder that leads the player right up to the top. |
